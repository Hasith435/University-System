# University-System
This is a system that is used to provide University Staff with a method for administration of student data. 

The "gui.py" file contains the main code for the program and the system's UI and is the frontend of the program 
The "student_functions.py" contains all the classes and the functions for each feature in the system and is the backend of the program 

The "university.xlsx" file is a spreadsheet and is the main database for the data that is meant to be stored by the university

The rest of the files are some essentials that are needed for the program to work effectively.
